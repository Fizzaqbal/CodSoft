# CodSoft
Welcome to the Codesoft AI Projects Repository! This repository contains code and documentation for three exciting AI tasks: Chatbot with Rule-Based Response, Image Captioning, and Recommendation System.

1. Chatbot with Rule-Based Response
In this project, we have implemented a rule-based chatbot. The chatbot is designed to respond to user queries and engage in conversations based on predefined rules and patterns. It can be a great starting point for building a simple chatbot with specific responses for common user inputs.

2. Image Captioning
The Image Captioning project focuses on generating textual descriptions for images. Using deep learning techniques, we have developed a model that can analyze an image and produce descriptive captions. This is a valuable application for enhancing image accessibility and understanding.
3. Recommendation System
Build a personalized recommendation system using collaborative or content-based filtering techniques to suggest movies, books, or products that match user preferences. Explore the world of recommendation algorithms to enhance user experiences.
