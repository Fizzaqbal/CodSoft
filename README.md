# CodSoft
Welcome to the Codesoft AI Projects Repository! This repository contains code and documentation for three exciting AI tasks: Chatbot with Rule-Based Response, Tic-Tac-Toe AI, and Recommendation System.

1. Chatbot with Rule-Based Response
In this project, we have implemented a rule-based chatbot. The chatbot is designed to respond to user queries and engage in conversations based on predefined rules and patterns. It can be a great starting point for building a simple chatbot with specific responses for common user inputs.

2. Tic-Tac-Toe AI
 Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows a human player to play against an AI opponent. The code handles player moves, AI moves using the minimax algorithm (without alpha-beta pruning), and determines the game's outcome, whether it's a win for the human, a win for the AI, or a draw.
3. Recommendation System
Build a personalized recommendation system using collaborative or content-based filtering techniques to suggest movies, books, or products that match user preferences. Explore the world of recommendation algorithms to enhance user experiences.
